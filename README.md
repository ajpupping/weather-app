# Weather Application

## Description 
[Check the Weather!](https://ajpupping.github.io/weather-app/)

The purpose of this web application is to search for weather conditions by city. 

I learned how to get an API key and use the Open Weather API to obtain search results.  

I had difficulty getting the data to display on the page and will need to revisit this aspect of the project at another time. 

## Usage

In the search bar, type in the name of a city and click search or hit enter. To view the results, open the console log. 

The list of previously searched cities will display at the bottom of the page.

## Credits 

I used [this guide](https://bithacker.dev/fetch-weather-openweathermap-api-javascript) to learn more about using the Open Weather API. 

[This page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent) helped me learn about the textContent property.

I learned about changing temperature units from [this guide](https://openweather.my.site.com/s/article/switching-between-temperature-units-2019-10-24-21-47-24).
